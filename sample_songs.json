and\nThe glare makes me hard to find\nJust know that I'm always\nParallel on the other side\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\n'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul\nI can tell you there's no place we couldn't go\nJust put your hand on the glass\nI'll be tryna pull you through\nYou just gotta be strong\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I don't wanna lose you now\nI'm lookin' right at the other half of me\nThe vacancy that sat in my heart\nIs a space that now you hold\nShow me how to fight for now\nAnd I'll tell you, baby, it was easy\nComin' back here to you once I figured it out\nYou were right here all along\n[Refrain]\nIt's like you're my mirror (Oh)\nMy mirror's staring back at me  (Oh)\nI couldn't get any bigger (Oh)\nWith anyone else beside me (Oh)\nAnd now it's clear as this promise\nThat we're making\nTwo reflections into one\n'Cause it's like you're my mirror (Oh)\nMy mirror's staring back at me, staring back at me\n\n[Verse 2]\nAren't you somethin', an original?\n'Cause it doesn't seem merely assembled\nAnd I can't help but stare, 'cause\nI see truth somewhere in your eyes\nOoh, I can't ever change without you\nYou reflect me, I love that about you\nAnd if I could, I\nWould look at us all the time\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\n'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul\nI can tell you there's no place we couldn't go\nJust put your hand on the glass\nI'm here tryna pull you through\nYou just gotta be strong\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I don't wanna lose you now\nI'm lookin' right at the other half of me\nThe vacancy that sat in my heart\nIs a space that now you hold\nShow me how to fight for now\nAnd I'll tell you, baby, it was easy\nComin' back here to you once I figured it out\nYou were right here all along\n\n[Refrain]\nIt's like you're my mirror (Oh)\nMy mirror's staring back at me (Oh)\nI couldn't get any bigger (Oh)\nWith anyone else beside me (Oh)\nAnd now it's clear as this promise\nThat we're making\nTwo reflections into one\n'Cause it's like you're my mirror (Oh)\nMy mirror's staring back at me, staring back at me\n\n[Bridge]\nYesterday is history, oh\nTomorrow's a mystery, oh\nI can see you lookin' back at me\nKeep your eyes on me\nBaby, keep your eyes on me\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I don't wanna lose you now\nI'm lookin' right at the other half of me\nThe vacancy that sat in my heart\nIs a space that now you hold\nShow me how to fight for now (You show me, baby)\nAnd I'll tell you, baby, it was easy\nComin' back here to you once I figured it out\nYou were right here all along\n\n[Refrain]\nIt's like you're my mirror (Oh)\nMy mirror's staring back at

song\nAnd I just wanna see your face light up since you put me on\nSo now I say goodbye to the old me, it's already gone\nAnd I can't wait, wait, wait, wait, wait to get you home\nJust to let you
